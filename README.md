# Pokemon App

**Statement of Work (SOW)**
- During your work use the latest version of the https://pokeapi.co/ REST API.
- List the different types of pokemons on the main screen. (Use a dropdown menu or picker)
- When one of the types is selected, list all the pokemon names which are assigned to this type.
- Upon selection of a pokemon, navigate to a profile card where you show some details about the selected pokemon.
- The detailed profile card needs to include: a picture of the pokemon, the name, weight, height, not hidden abilities.
- On the same screen implement a 'catch' button, on click, the pokemon should be catched. You will need to mark the catched pokemons on the list. (example: green border, whatever...). When a pokemon is catched, the button should turn to 'release', if you want to release them back to the wild.
- Implement a checkbox next to the search bar to list only your catched pokemons.
- Add some navigation to go back on the webpage, and do not fetch the data again
- Use a loader / spinner while fetching data.
